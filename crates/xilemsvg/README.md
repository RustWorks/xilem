# Xilemsvg prototype

This is a proof of concept showing how to use `xilem_core` to render interactive vector graphics into SVG DOM nodes, running in a browser. A next step would be to factor it into a library so that applications can depend on it, but at the moment the test scene is baked in.

The easiest way to run it is to use [Trunk]. Run `trunk serve`, then navigate the browser to the link provided (usually `http://localhost:8080`).
